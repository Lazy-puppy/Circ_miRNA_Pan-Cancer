Accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis is essential for early cancer intervention and appropriate treatment selection. 
This study constructed a comprehensive circulating miRNA signature utilized three machine learning algorithms for early cancer detection. 
23,484 samples with 25 types of cancer and control were used, representing the largest and most comprehensive clinical cohort to date. 
The data was allocated into training and validation sets with an additional external test set. 
Among three advanced machine learning algorithms, Deep Forest algorithm showed the most excellent performance for cancer diagnosis and cancer type classification, optimized through 5-fold cross-validation and grid search. 
Reliability and Efficacy of the classifier was further confirmed on the external test sets. 
Analysis of critical miRNAs selected by Random Forest and Deep Forest revealed similarities and differences within and between cancers, aligning with the purpose of pan-cancer research. 
Downstream evaluation of molecular process and pathways provided novel perspective on cancer development and progression.
Here, we show how the miRNA context-dependent action can be exploited to gain high confidence predictions in the largest clinical cohorts, uncovering known and unknown associations between miRNA and cancer phenotype.
